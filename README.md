Summarization of Web Articles and Audio Output Generation

![briefly logo](./assets/images/Logo.png)

Brief.ly is a Web Application that aims to retrieve a certain article, news or any textual information from the provided URL of the website and convert the same to a perfect short version summary which would be finally turned into an audio format that could be easily listened to. We intend to implement web-scraping, extractive summarization and text-to-speech conversion to give the desired output. Our main motive with this project is to spend mundane time wisely by listening to something productive for instance while traveling.
