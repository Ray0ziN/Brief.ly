Summarization of Web Articles and Audio Output Generation

Brief.ly is a Web Application that aims to retrieve a certain article, news or any textual information from the provided URL of the website and convert the same to a perfect short version summary which would be finally turned into an audio format that could be easily listened to. We intend to implement web-scraping, extractive summarization and text-to-speech conversion to give the desired output. Our main motive with this project is to spend mundane time wisely by listening to something productive for instance while traveling. Why make this project?
